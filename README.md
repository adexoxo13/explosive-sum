Explosive-Sum

Effortlessly calculate the number of ways to partition a number into sums of positive integers.

📚 What is a Partition?

In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer 
n
n is a way of writing 
n
n as a sum of positive integers, without considering the order of the summands. For instance, 
4
4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:

4
4
3
+
1
3+1
2
+
2
2+2
2
+
1
+
1
2+1+1
1

1
+
1
+
1
1+1+1+1
This is different from a composition, where the order of summands does matter. For example, 
3
+
1
3+1 and 
1
+
3
1+3 are considered the same partition but different compositions.

Basic Examples
sum(1); // 1
// Partition: 1

sum(2); // 2
// Partitions: 1+1, 2

sum(3); // 3
// Partitions: 1+1+1, 1+2, 3

sum(4); // 5
// Partitions: 1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 1+3, 2+2, 4
Explosive Growth
sum(10); // 42
sum(50); // 204226
sum(80); // 15796476
sum(100); // 190569292

🌐 Mathematical Context

The number of partitions of a number 
n
n is denoted 
p
(
n
)
p(n). The famous mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan and others developed remarkable insights into this function. For example:

Generating Function: The partitions of 
n
n are encoded in the infinite product:
P
(
x
)
=
∏

=

.
P(x)= 
k=1
∏

Asymptotic Growth: Using advanced methods, it’s known that:
p

📦 Installation

To use this project, simply clone the repository and include the provided functions in your project.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/explosive-sum.git
🧑‍💻 Usage

Include the function in your program and call it with any positive integer:

const sum = require('./explosive-sum');

console.log(sum(5)); // Output: 7
console.log(sum(10)); // Output: 42
🛠️ How It Works

This implementation uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute partitions, storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations. The recursive formula is based on Euler’s Pentagonal Number Theorem for generating functions.
